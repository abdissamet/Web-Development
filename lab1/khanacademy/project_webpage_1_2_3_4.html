            </ul>
            <li><em>Seeing monkeys and taking photos with them.</em></li>
            <li><em>The most beautiful place in the jungle is to see a waterfall.</em></li>

        <p><strong>Exotic tigers</strong> are rare and beautiful big cats found mostly in Asia. They have striking orange fur with black stripes, which helps them camouflage in forests and grasslands. Tigers are powerful predators that hunt deer, wild boar, and other animals. Some exotic types include <em>Bengal, Siberian, Sumatran, and Malayan</em> tigers. They are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching, so conservation efforts are very important.</p>
        <h3 id="Exotic-Monkey">Our third animal is Exotic Monkey.</h3>

        <p><strong>Exotic monkeys</strong> are small to medium-sized primates found in tropical forests of <em>Asia, Africa, and Central and South America.</em> They are smart, social, and often live in groups. They eat fruits, leaves, insects, and sometimes small animals. Popular <strong>exotic monkeys</strong> include <em>Capuchins, Howler monkeys, and Spider monkeys.</em> Many species are endangered because of deforestation and illegal pet trade.</p>
        <h1 class="Waterfall">Our last destination is the waterfall.</h1>
