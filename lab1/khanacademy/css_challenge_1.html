        <p>The <strong>cheetah</strong> is the <em>fastest</em> land animal in the world. It can run<br> 
            at speeds of up to 100–120 km/h in short bursts. Cheetahs live mainly in Africa and in a<br>
            small part of Iran. They have a slim body, long legs, and black spots that help them blend<br>
            into the environment. Cheetahs hunt during the day and mainly eat small to medium-sized animals<br>
            such as gazelles.
